# MazeRunner
C# Project I am working on to practice C#

This is a project that takes a .bmp, .jpg, or .png as input and provides a .bmp, .jpg, or .png as output based on the user's preference.

The input is treated as a maze where black pixels are walls, red pixels are the start, and blue pixels are the end points. 
Green pixels in the output image describe the path taken.

Algorithms used in this project are A* Search, Uniform Cost Search, and Greedy Search in order to find the exit.
